Tiling:
    Well we're not actually tiling, we're unrolling. Which is useless.
    Why is it worse? According to Agner Fog:
        "The difference in performance between loops that fit into the µop cache
        and loops that do not can be quite significant". This is a pretty small
        cache. By unrolling we blow out of it.

    What would ACTUALLY benefit?
        anything where we accumulate something into ONE value at the end.

Vectorization doesn't give 4x:
    Unaligned loads. If we don't unroll we can use aligned loads again.
    Note that this is only a factor between processor and L1.
        (http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=415, search for "align")

    Subnormals. There is a large penalty for subnormal numbers

Performance stays constant
