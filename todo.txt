1) Script for automatic memory transfers counters which uses the caller/callee DAG. 

2) ! The printing of the model is suppressed but the actualy call to inference 
	is not so computation is performed outside RUN_EM. 

3) Benchmark float against double - tradeoff between precision and speed muhaha

4) Computational optimization - Cache results of function called repetedly 

5) "Better"  pie-chart

6) Bechmark functions individualy, Fred suggest independent timings

7) All the otehr optimizations: ILP, scalar replacement, register level optimizations

8) SIMD
