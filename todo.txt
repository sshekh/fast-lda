4) Computational optimization - Cache results of function called repetedly

4.1) static inline on util functions

5) "Better"  pie-chart

6) Bechmark functions individualy, Fred suggest independent timings

7) All the otehr optimizations: ILP, scalar replacement, register level optimizations

8) SIMD
