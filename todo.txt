4) Computational optimization - Cache results of function called repeatedly
    i.e. use lookup tables

4.1) Force inline of util functions

5) "Better"  pie-chart

6) Benchmark functions individually, Fred suggests independent timings

7) All the other optimizations: ILP, scalar replacement, register level optimizations

8) SIMD
    compute_likelihood and lda_inference are two big ones
    Perhaps something can be done inside the convergence loop for alpha
