4) Computational optimization - Cache results of function called repeatedly
    i.e. use lookup tables

5) "Better"  pie-chart

6) Benchmark functions individually, Fred suggests independent timings

7) All the other optimizations: ILP, scalar replacement, register level optimizations

8) SIMD
    compute_likelihood and lda_inference are two big ones
    Perhaps something can be done inside the convergence loop for alpha


9) Use _mm_malloc to force alignment and then only use aligned loads/stores.
