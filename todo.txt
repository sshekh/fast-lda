- Run ICC vs GCC comparison  <- Data on Fred's machine
- Update weighting of different types of Flops <- BG has looked into it, difficult to obtain meaningful results

- Vectorization affects convergence loops, find out why
- Try running the big corpus on floats <- BG
- Runtime plot: average per convergence loop <- SS
- Plot convergence counters <- SS
