0) Rip out useless code
    saving the model, etc. (we removed printing for instrumentation, 
    						do you need to save the model for the validation still?)
2) Generate smaller reference outputs from the various parameter ranges decided upon
5) Do the flop counts
	RUN_EM, DOC_E_STEP <- Saurav
	LDA_INFERENCE <- Ben
	DIGAMMA, LOG_SUM, LOG_GAMMA <- Cristina
	LIKELIHOOD <- Fred
6) Script to run the timings for different input size and plot performance.
7) Look for better implementations of LDA :-/
7) Update project descriptions:
		point 3 - saving the model and printing removed.
		point 4 - decribe validation
		point 5 - update after we run the script in 6)
		point 6 - update the flops count
		point 7 - performance plot decription
		point 8 - describe if there are optimized versions of LDA
